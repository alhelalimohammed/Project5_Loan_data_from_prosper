# Project5_Loan_data_from_prosper
## Dataset
The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, loan term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc. The dataset can be found here, with feature documentation available here

## Summary of Findeings
The distribution of borrowers APR and borrowers Rate appears multimodal. Most of the values fall in the range of 0.05 and 0.4. The borrowed amounts are reasonable in proportion to the monthly income, except in some cases, I will mention them in the next paragraph. There are no unusual points and no need to make any shifts.The correlation coefficient of borrower APR and loan original amount is -0.323, the scatter plot also shows that these two variables are negatively correlated, which agrees with our hypothesis, that is the more the loan amount, the lower the APR. The loan original amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, it makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income could loan more money.After looking at the demonstration, it turned out that it is negative because the higher the amount, the lower the interest rate for the borrower APR.. The borrower APR decreases with the better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR. Borrowers with better rating also have larger monthly income and loan amount. Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers.The employment status variable do not have enough data on part-time, retired and not employed borrowers to show its interaction with term and Prosper rating variables. But we can see that there is a interaction between term and Prosper rating. Proportionally, there are more 60 month loans on B and C ratings. There is only 36 months loans for HR rating borrowers.The loan amount increases with better rating. The borrower APR decreases with better rating. Interestingly, the relationship between borrower APR and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings are increased from HR to A or better. This may because people with A or AA ratings tend to borrow more money, increasting APR could prevent them borrow even more and maximize the profit. But people with lower ratings tend to borrow less money, decreasing APR could encourage them to borrow more.

## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I just focus on features that could affect the borrower APR, which are original loan amount, Prosper rating. I started by showing the distribution of borrower APR and loan amount variable. Then, I showed the relationship between APR vs. loan amount, as well as APR vs. rating. I also investigated the effect of rating on ralationship between APR and loan amount, as well as the effect of rating on relationship between borrower APR and term as well as the effect of Loan Original Amount, Borrower APR and Stated Monthly Income
